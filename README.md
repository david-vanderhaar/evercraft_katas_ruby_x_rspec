## why
I'm performing [these katas](https://github.com/PuttingTheDnDInTDD/EverCraft-Kata/blob/master/README.md) to gain a better understanding of ruby, rspec, and test driven development.

## what I've learned so far
- how to set up rspec
- several rspec matchers and when to use them (ex: to be vs. to eq)
- the TDD cycle of Red, Green, Refactor
- ruby's attr_accessor
- RSpec shared_examples_for and it_behaves_like for common functaionalities betweens classes
- code coverage using simplecov
- expect to receive requires the call to happen after the exepct line
- Rspec custom matchers (be_boolean)
